# Samuel Amihere - Machine-Learning Projects
## About
Hi, I'm Samuel! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Logistics Engineering (From Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing-China). I majored in logistics information system and data processing. I also hold Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Mathematics-with-Economics (from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana). I had worked for over a year, playing roles as Inventory Analyst and an internship as Assistant Machine Learning Engineer. I have completed a year software engineering program with ALX Africa, where I specialized in backend development. I am open to Software Engineering, Data Engineering and Machine learning roles with great opportunities for career development

## 2. Loan Application Classification Project

This project, encapsulated within the Jupyter Notebook `Samuel_Amihere_Classification-Assignment.ipynb`, aims to address the challenge of efficiently processing a sudden influx of loan applications using machine learning classification models. The objective is to provide a list of creditworthy customers to the manager within an expedited timeframe.

## Problem Statement

The team typically processes around 200 loan applications per week manually. However, there's been a significant increase in the number of applicants, with nearly 500 loan applications received for processing this week. The challenge is to manage this surge efficiently, ensuring timely and accurate processing of loan applications.

## Objective

The primary goal is to leverage the available data to identify and provide a list of creditworthy customers to the manager within the next two days, thereby streamlining the decision-making process for loan approvals.

## Available Information

To achieve this objective, the following resources are available:
1. Data on all past loan applications, which can be used to train the classification models.
2. The list of customers whose applications need to be processed in the upcoming days.

## Methodology

The approach to solving this challenge involves several key steps:

1. **Business and Data Understanding**: Analyze the problem domain and the available data to gain insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions.
2. **Explore and Cleanup the Data**: Preprocess the data by cleaning and preparing it for modeling. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
3. **Train Classification Models**: Develop and train multiple classification models to predict the creditworthiness of the applicants. The models include:
   - Naive Bayes
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Compare the performance of all trained models using appropriate metrics to select the best-performing model.
5. **Scoring New Customers**: Use the selected model to score the new loan applications and identify creditworthy customers.

## Conclusion

The notebook concludes with a write-up that compares the performance of all models and provides recommendations on the best model based on the analysis. This model is then used to score new customers, aiding the manager in making informed loan approval decisions within the constrained timeframe.
