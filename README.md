# Samuel Amihere - Machine-Learning Projects
## About
Hi, I'm Samuel! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Logistics Engineering (From Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing-China). I majored in logistics information system and data processing. I also hold Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Mathematics-with-Economics (from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana). I had worked for over a year, playing roles as Inventory Analyst and an internship as Assistant Machine Learning Engineer. I have completed a year software engineering program with ALX Africa, where I specialized in backend development. I am open to Software Engineering, Data Engineering and Machine learning roles with great opportunities for career development

# Machine-Learning Projects
1. ## Linear Regression
Implement a linear regression predictor from scratch to predict the fire radiation power of various fires in Australia.

**Code:** [`Group3_Final_Regression.ipynb`](https://github.com/amihere2830-ML/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Group3_Final_Regression.ipynb)

### Skills Gained in the ML Linear Regression Project:

1. **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Acquired a solid understanding of linear regression principles and how to apply them to real-world data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Learned techniques for cleaning, normalizing, and splitting data to prepare it for modeling.

3. **Programming**: Enhanced Python programming skills, particularly in using libraries like NumPy and pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

4. **Model Development**: Gained hands-on experience in developing, training, and testing a linear regression model from scratch.

5. **Team Leadership**: As the team leader, developed skills in project coordination, task delegation, and fostering collaboration among team members.

6. **Analytical Thinking**: Improved ability to analyze and interpret data to draw meaningful conclusions and make predictions.

7. **Problem-Solving**: Enhanced problem-solving skills by addressing challenges encountered in model development and data analysis.

8. **Communication**: Learned to effectively communicate complex technical concepts and findings to team members and stakeholders.

9. **Critical Evaluation**: Gained experience in evaluating the performance of the regression model using metrics like R-squared and MSE, and iterating on the model accordingly.

10. **Research**: Enhanced research skills by exploring and applying advanced techniques to improve model accuracy and performance.
